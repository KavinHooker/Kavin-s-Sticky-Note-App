# Kavin's-Sticky-Note-App

# What is this code and why did it make it?
This is my Sticky Note app, I made this for my intro to software development class and when told what kind of this I could make as the final project I instantly thought of a sticky note app.  This is my first attempt at anything related to making a GUI but I think that it has turned out pretty good for a first attempt.

# Who is this for?
This was made for anyone who can run it really, it is simple to use and all of the buttons are self explainitory as well as having a well known concept as a base.

# Why are there two files?
The file that has test in its name was the original file that I had started just to get the base of the app down it is small and slimmed down and is relitivly simple and the file without test in its name is the actual project.

# Disclaimer
This app has no way to save the contents of it at this point and you wll lose all info in it the moment you close it. I still haven't determined whether or not if I will add that feature or not as this is me first attempt at something like this but that is to be determined.

# Features
1. A space to put text
2. Buttons to go to the next or previous page
3. A button to rip off a page (Makes a new window)
4. A darkmode toggle (Doesn't carry over to the rippped off pages)

# How each button works
**Dark mode**: Does exactly what you think it does, when clicked it changes the back ground and buttons to black and dark gray respectively and can be be untoggled just by clicking it again.

**Previous and Next arrows**: Flip through the pages, the pages will keep what you typed in them unfil you delete what is in them or close the app.

**Rip Off**: Tries to mimic the functionallity if how you would actualy rip off a sticky note in real life, it does this by making a new window that can be moved and controled seperately from the main program. The text in the note can be modified while it is seperated but you can not rename the note once it hasbeen "ripped off".

**Rename**: Lets you rename the page that it is useed on. I still haven't found a way to make it so that it doesn't change the name of the program when a new one is entered but, all name are remembered and if you rip off a page that has been renamedthen the name that was given to it will be the anme of the window making it easier to identify what note is what while hovering over its icon on the task bar.
