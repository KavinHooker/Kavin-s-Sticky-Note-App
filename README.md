# Kavin's-Sticky-Note-App
This is my Sticky Note app

# Why are there two files?
The file that has test in its name was the original file that I had started just to get the base of the app down and the file without test in its name is the actual project.

# Features
1. A space to put text
2. Buttons to go to the next or previous page
3. A button to rip off a page (Makes a new window)
4. A darkmode toggle (Doesn't carry over to the rippped off pages)

# Disclaimer
This app has no way to save the contents of it at this point and you wll lose all info in it the moment you close it. I still haven't determined whether or not if I will add that feature or not as this is me first attempt at something like this but that is to be determined.
