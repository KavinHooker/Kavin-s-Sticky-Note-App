# Kavin's-Sticky-Note-App
This is my Sticky Note app

This app has:
1. A space to put text
2. Buttons to go to the next or previous page
3. A button to rip off a page (Makes a new window)
4. A darkmode toggle (Doesn't carry over to the rippped off pages)

# Disclaimer
This app has no way to save the contents of it at this point and you wll lose all info in it the moment you close it. I still haven't determined whether or not if I will add that feature or not as this is me first attempt at something like this but that is to be determined.

# How each button works (Explaination)
*Dark mode* button does exactly what you think it does, when clicked it changes the back ground and buttons to black and dark gray respectively and can be be untoggled just by clicking it again.

*Previous and Next arrows* flip through the pages, the pages will keep what you typed in them unfil you delete what is in them or close the app.
